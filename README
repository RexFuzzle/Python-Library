At this point there are two available functions in the library.
The first is a polynomial spectral method differentiation matrix assembler. This is called poldif.m and is part of the Spectral_Functions.py. To call:
import Spectral_Functions as spec
D=spec.poldif(np.linspace(0,1,10),1)
for example. This is the implementation by Weideman and Reddy from 1998 which has been adapted fro python.
The second function implements the surf function from octave/matlab. It is called as follows:
from Plot_Functions import surf
surf(z,x,y)

x and y are optional and if not given linspace between 0 and 1 in used for plotting a surface plot of z.

Please add the folder these functions are extracted to to your python path.
